1. Create either a public or a private repo on GitHub
2. Clone the repo and copy both alphanumeric.py and green.py to the local repo
3. Adjust variables on main() and run

## Limitations

* Commits generated by this function appears on GitHub's contribution graph as intended, but if you check the history of dummy repo on GitHub, it'll show you the system time at the moment of commit, instead of the modified timestamp you would see on `git log`
